  dialogue:
  - Welcome to the wind island. Please keep in mind that attacking is forbidden on
    this island.
  - Platforms on this island are powered by the wind.
  - Their colors dictate their behaviors...
  - 'The <color=green>green</color> platforms are static.

    The <color=blue>blue</color>
    platforms can move.

    The <color=red>red</color> platforms are fragile.'
  - Observe, be patient, and jump!
  - Reach the highest peak to grasp the power of the wind.
  - '(Hint: You can respawn at the last activated checkpoint by using Escape -> Respawn.)'
